This project was created during my university years to enhance my skills. The main purpose of the project is to provide users who want to watch Korean dramas with different genres based on their ages.

Features
- After entering their age, users are presented with different genres for those under and over 15 years old.
- Available genre options include Romantic, Crime, and Animation.
- Once the user has made all their selections, the application retrieves suitable Korean drama titles from the database.
- It downloads images of the relevant dramas from the internet and presents the title along with the image to the user.

Functionality
- Age Entry: The user specifies their age.
- Genre Selection: One or more of the genres presented based on age is selected.
- Drama Recommendations: The application retrieves suitable Korean drama titles from the database.
- Visual Presentation: Images related to the selected dramas are downloaded from the internet and presented to the user.
